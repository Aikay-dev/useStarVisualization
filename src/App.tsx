            Now, behold the magic of{" "}

              useStarVisualization
            </span>
            ! Simply pass the{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>rating</span> value, the
            desired number of stars, and an object of your desired styling as
            parameters. Witness the marvel as you receive an array of{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>font awesome stars</span>,
            each represented by a CSS class, ready to be seamlessly integrated
            into your UI. Ah, do you find yourself pondering over a style fit
            for the celestial stars? Worry not, for{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              useStarVisualization
            </span>{" "}
            includes default styling out of the box! If you wish to use the
            default style, just pass in an empty object in the styling part of
            the hook. Allow me to demonstrate a function with the default
            styling:{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              useStarVisualization(data.rating.rate, 5, {"{}"})
            </span>
            . By passing an empty object as the third argument, you prevent
            overwriting any of the default styles. ‚òØÔ∏è

          <p>
            With every piece of software ever created, there are bound to be
            some errors ‚Äî some of which can be quite humorous! Fear not, for the{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              useVisualization Hook
            </span>{" "}
            comes equipped with robust error handling logic to prevent users
            from unleashing chaos on their UIs. Let's take a look at some of the
            witty and informative error messages that you might encounter:
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚≠ê Oh dear! It seems you've mixed up the data order when passing it
            into the hook. Remember, it should be in the following sequence:{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>Rating</span>,{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>StarCount</span> (the
            number of base Stars you want to display), and an object containing
            your custom <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>style</span>.{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>TypeScript</span>{" "}
            enthusiasts, rejoice!{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>TypeScript</span> has got
            your back and will ensure the correct types are used. But hey, if
            you're daring enough to abandon{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>TypeScript</span> and dive
            into JavaScript land, I strongly recommend adding some{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>type checks</span> using
            conditionals to avoid unexpected issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚≠ê Hold on a second! The Rating count (that's the rating of the
            particular product) should never exceed the{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>StarCount</span>. We don't
            want to end up with one product shining brightly with 7 base stars
            while another has just 5. Let's keep it consistent, clean, and
            visually appealing! So, if you try using the function like this:{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              useStarVisualization(7, 5, {"{}"})
            </span>
            , it won't display stars but will kindly remind you, "Rating should
            be equal to or less than Starcount". Trust me, it's for the greater
            good of UI harmony!
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚≠ê Negative stars? Not in this universe! Sorry, but we can't allow a
            product to be rated below 0. Who knows what dark matter lies beyond
            that? If by some cosmic mishap, a negative value slips through our
            defenses, we'll gracefully present you with a gentle message:
            "Rating should be equal to 0 or greater". Rest assured, you'll know
            what to do to bring the universe back into balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚≠ê Time for some house rules! You can't pass a{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>starCount</span> value
            less than or equal to 0. Even the cosmos demands at least one star
            to be shining in the sky! Don't worry; we've got you covered, and
            we'll make sure at least one star graces your UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚≠ê Lastly, welcome to the realm of custom CSS{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>styles</span>! If you're
            not sure how to wield the cosmic power of JavaScript to apply those{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>styles</span>, fear not!
            Simply remember to use{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>camelCase</span> for
            properties instead of{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>kebab-case</span>. For
            example, in regular CSS, you'd write{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              background-color: red
            </span>
            , but in JavaScript, it's{" "}
            <span style={{ fontFamily: "monospace" }}>
              backgroundColor: "red"
            </span>
            . Just a small adjustment to ensure your styling works its
            magic!
